# Tonfall #

**Tonfall** is an Actionscript framework to get you started in audio dsp programming within the Flashplayer(10+).
**Tonfall** introduces only a vague design of an audio engine and is rather focussed on readability and simplicity than performance optimizations.
**Tonfall** was initially written for the 'Audio Code Clash' workshop at 'Flash on the beach' conference 2010 in Brighton and used since then for several workshops.
